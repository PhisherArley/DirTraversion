This is an attempt of replicating the dir command, not all the commands will have the same output as the original dir command.
To compile use Visual Studio cl.exe (you can find it in the 'Developer Command Prompt for VS-'):
    cl main.c (any other file in this directory)

The main file must be the first in the command line
